There are 6 16 bit processor registers.
There are 10 32 bit processor registers.

Main registers:
- General registers
  - Data registers
  - Pointer registers
  - Index registers
- Control registers
- Segment registers

Data registers
    64 bit registers are RAX, RBX, RCX, RDX
    32 bit registers are EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX
    Half of the storage of these registers is used to represent AX, BX, CX, DX registers (16 bit registers)
     Half of the storage of 16 bit registers is used to represent AH, BH, CH, DH, AL, BL, CL, DL registers (8 bit registers)

    AX - Accumulator: Mainly used for IO, Arithmetic instructions
    BX - Base: Used for addressing index addresses
    CX - Counter: Store the loop count in iterations
    DX - Data: Can be used for IO, with AX

Special registers
    RSP: Points to the current top of the stack.
    RBP: Base pointer during function calls
    RIP: Points to the next instruction to be executed

XMM registers
    They are 128 bit registers and are used to support 64-bit and 32-bit floating-point operations and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions, which allows a single instruction to be applied to multiple data items simultaneously.
    They are named xmm0, xmm1, xmm2, ..., xmm15
    Recent x86-64 processors support 256-bit XMM registers.

Memory layout for programs is:
    stack
    heap
    BSS - uninitialized data
    data - decalared variables with initial value at assemble-time
    text (code)
    reserved - not available to user programs

Memory hierarchy (gets larger, slower, less expensive as you go downwards)
    CPU registers - 1 ns
    Cache - 5-60 ns
    Primary storage - 100-150 ns
    Secondary storage - 3-15 ms
    Tertiary storage

Two's complement
    Take the number
    Reverse all the bits
    Add 1

Floating points are stored in IEEE 754 32-bit floating point standard??
ASCII Characters are stored in 8-bits.


==================== ASSEMBLY ====================

When specifying decimal, no special notation is required
When specifying hex, 0x must be added as a prefix
When specifying octal, q must be add as a suffix

To define a constant,
    <name> equ <value>

To initalize a variable in the data section,
    <variable name> <data type> <initial value>

    Data types are:
      db: 8-bit
      dw: 16-bit
      dd: 32-bit
      dq: 64-bit
      ddq: 128-bit integer
      dt: 128-bit float

    Strings are defined through db

  To initalize a variable in the bss section,
    <variable name> <res type> <count>

    Res types are:
      resb: 8-bit
      resw: 16-bit
      resd: 32-bit
      resq: 64-bit
      resdq: 128-bit

  Code is placed in the text section, which includes headers of labels that define the program entry point.
  Basic text section has:
    section .text
    global _start
    _start:
