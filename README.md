# Learning Assembly

## So, what is this repository anyways?
I'm learning assembly (x86-64 Assembly, to be specific) through the book "x86-64 Assembly Language Programming with Ubuntu" by Ed Jorgensen.\
The book contains various example programs, and suggsted project programs for readers to attempt to solve as a recap on the topics covered in a chapter.\
This repository contains my solutions to each of these questions. Granted, a few of them may be eerily similar to the solution in the book (which may or ~~may not~~ be because I copied the answer), but in general I try to add at least a little variation or optimization if I can figure out how to do so.\

## Commit Schedule
I try to contribute to this repository at least once a day.
